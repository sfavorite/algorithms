# Euclid's algorithm - greatest common divisor

Get the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integers using Euclid's algorithm
by step wise replacement of the larger of the two integers (or either if they are equal)
by its difference with the smaller number.

## Example (very simple)
Input integers 3 & 9

Subtract the smallest from the largest until zero.

1. 9 - 3 = 6
2. 6 - 3 = 3
3. 3 - 3 = 0
We now have 3 and 0 - the gcd is 3.
