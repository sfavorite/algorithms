Random algorithms written primarily in C, Python, Javascript and PHP. These are written as standalone programs and as standalone functions.
You will find many of these to be trivial, others more interesting.

The following is a list of the algorithms currently posted. Not all algorithms are written in each
of the languages listed above...I selected the language based on my mood and what other projects
I was working on at the time I added that particular algorithm. There are some other minor routines
that I have not included in this list (i.g. reversing a string).
